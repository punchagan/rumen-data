I had never successfully used a Hobonichi before, or </span><em>any</em><span> dated planner for that matter, so I wanted to challenge myself to fill this book with a whole year’s worth of entries.</span></p><p>The year came and went, and I accomplished my goal!! I had completed the 2024 Cousin with almost all pages filled out.</p><p>Aaaaaaand</p><p>I hated it LOLL 💀💀💀</p><p><span>From the very beginning of the year, I couldn’t make the Cousin work for me. Honestly, everything was wrong 😭 The paper was too thin. I never used the weekly views. I didn’t like how the book got bloated as I pasted in photos and ephemera. I didn’t like the daily pages: I felt claustrophobic on the days where I wanted to record far more than what my 1 allotted page allowed; yet I hated how the empty pages would pile up in a blink of an eye. Many days, I felt pressured to write </span><em>something, anything! </em><span>in fear of the daunting backlog that would await me if I didn’t, so I would joylessly contrive an ugly, hasty, lazy entry just to be done with it. I felt exhausted every time I thought about updating this journal. The Cousin was just </span><em>not a fit</em><span> for how I like to document my life!!!</span></p><p><span>Despite this, I forced myself to stick with it anyway. I ignored the fact that </span><em>I kinda hated it!!</em><span> and slogged through. I was so sure</span><em> </em><span>that this was the right call — that this was </span><em>perseverance</em><span>! Aren’t you supposed to keep going when things are hard?</span></p><p>But by the end of 2024, what was my reward for this steadfast discipline? I had a completely-filled Hobonichi Cousin… that I also completely HATED 😭</p><p><span>In retrospect, OF COURSE I hated it! What was I thinking?? I didn’t like the layouts </span><em>as I was making them</em><span> lol, so obviously by the end of the year I’d have… a journal filled with pages I didn’t like.</span></p><p><span>I was soooooooo annoyed!! Why did I think </span><em>sticking to my plan</em><span> was the important part, vs y’know, having a journal I enjoyed using and liked to look at?? What exactly did I accomplish by “keeping one journal for the whole year,” when I hated the experience </span><em>and</em><span> the output???</span></p><p><span>To make matters worse, 2024 was a year</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-186929632" href="https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/p/my-journals-and-planners-for-2026#footnote-1-186929632" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> that ended up having so many important personal milestones for me 😭 Like, Pouch Issue 1 launch? My first-ever zine fair? The first-ever Stationery Fest? I GOT ENGAGED??? 😆 But because I was determined to </span><em>just keep going at all costs!</em><span>, all these precious memories are recorded in this journal that I… tbh hate to look at LOL 😭😭😭</span></p><p><span>And I mean, of course: Yes, I still love that I have a record of these memories! Will I look back at this 10 years from now and love this journal? Probably! Even now, I can look at my 2024 Cousin today and I am starting to see the </span><em>memories</em><span> more than I see how much this journal enrages me LOL.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg" width="616" height="330.4230769230769" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:781,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:616,&quot;bytes&quot;:356017,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/i/186929632?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r2GD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b965085-e0f5-45eb-8054-bf7a15c32207_2048x1099.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Like this entry is unironically incredible LOL</figcaption></figure></div><p>But in December 2024?</p><p>DISASTER.

Sadly it’s just really tricky to recap because I made so many pivots!</p><p>Instead of going through EVERYTHING, I’m going to cover the 4 journals I learned from the most, along with a summary of those learnings 💖 Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Notebook:</strong><span> Midori MD B6 Slim, Blank</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png" width="728" height="489.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:979,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:16175383,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/i/186929632?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HIdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff485743f-6bdf-4616-aa39-b349d1c581b4_4116x2767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>I LOVE THESE</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The last two weeks of October 2025, Davis and I went on our honeymoon to Korea! Inspired by the many travel journals in Pouch Issue #2 — </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/travale/" rel="">Rosemary’s</a><span> was for </span><em>her</em><span> </span><em>honeymoon</em><span>, even! — I was determined to make a travel journal for our trip, too.</span></p><p><span>Despite my best intentions, I did almost zero journaling while </span><em>in</em><span> Korea lol, and I came back to the US with an overwhelming amount of memories, photos, and mementos I wanted to record from those two weeks. What to do??</span></p><p>I considered timeboxing the task to a weekend project: Just do my best, maybe print one photo per day of the trip, write a few notes, that’s it. Done is better than perfect, right?</p><p>…But this was such a special trip!! I felt like I could do a better job than that. Instead of rushing through, what if I went slow? What if I took as much time as I needed to record this trip properly?</p><p>Of course, the worry is always “that I won’t finish it at all,” so I created a few rules to make completion more likely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Make progress every day.</strong><span> Every morning, I dedicated time to make SOME progress on the Korea journals. It was OK if all I did was write a sentence. If I just kept going, </span><em>eventually</em><span> I would be done!</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Simple, consistent style.</strong><span> I used styles, stickers, and washis I knew I liked. I kept my text treatments consistent. I stuck to my comfort zone when it came to layout and design. This allowed me to complete pages quickly while keeping them visually pleasing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimal, meaningful ephemera.</strong><span> Rather than splat ALL THE EPHEMERA into the pages, I was </span><em>super</em><span> selective about what went in and made sure it either looked nice or was something I </span><em>really</em><span> wanted to keep.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>And in my back pocket, I still gave myself the option: If I REALLY wasn’t making progress, I </span><em>would</em><span> just print a few photos and call it a day.</span></p><p>I started this project in mid-November, and it took me around two months to finish recording everything. It was so worth it! I love them so much!! (Polar opposite of my 2024 debacle! 😭) It took four Midori MD B6 Slim’s to contain everything I wanted to record, and I think the results are so beautiful. Every page easily evokes memories from our trip, and — I enjoyed the experience of journaling in them, too!! 💓</p><p><strong>💡 If I journal every day, I don’t have to journal about THAT day. </strong><span>Daily journaling DOES NOT have to mean, I’m documenting </span><em>yesterday</em><span> or </span><em>today</em><span>. If I’m backlogging something from months ago, that’s fine! Giving myself the freedom to choose what (and how much) I wanted to journal each day </span><em>really</em><span> brought joy back into my practice.</span></p><p><strong>💡 I want my memory-keeping journals to be pretty, and that means taking </strong><em><strong>fewer</strong></em><strong> design risks. </strong><span>I relied on “safe and easy” designs simply out of convenience: If I had hemmed and hawed over every page, I would have never finished. But thanks to this constraint, all four of my Korea journals look really pretty to me!! For the first time I realized that my desire to </span><em>stretch</em><span> </span><em>my design skills</em><span> and and my desire </span><em>to make my pretty journal</em><span> were at odds with each other</span><em>.</em><span> Sometimes I wanted to try a wild design idea or push myself to use a design element I’d never tried before, and these experiments could look… weird LOL, which in turn made my journals look weird! I won’t stop experimenting because I still want to grow, but I realized I want to keep the BIG swings out of my journals and reserve them for sketchbooks instead. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg" width="728" height="412" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:824,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:2294061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/i/186929632?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ts2p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8e0eff-b0f2-41fb-b903-133924ab4010_6000x3396.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“I should have taken a photo of the pond” → No problem, I’ll draw it instead!!</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>💡 I can draw when I don’t have a photo. </strong><span>Whenever I journal, there’s a moment I kick myself for forgetting to take a photo of something that </span><em>really</em><span> would have been nice to capture.

Because I was using this BIG weird size, and I think because I was in a sketchbook, I ended up going really experimental with my layouts.</p><p>Here I learned the inverse of what I discovered from my travel journals: </p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>I loved having a place to try REALLY different designs that stretch me out of my comfort zone.</strong><span> Pushing myself in this way helped me grow as a designer and discover new layouts to add to my rotation.</span></p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>But the visual results are unpredictable, so the journal ends up hard to follow.</strong><span> When I do this sort of design stretching, all the pages are necessarily going to look SUPER different from each other. It ends up being a distraction: When I want to look back on my memories, I want to focus on the </span><em>memories</em><span>, not the wacky designs.</span></p><p><span>💡 </span><strong>So let’s keep these goals separate!</strong><span> I want to keep my design experiments OUT of my memory-keeping journal and reserve them for a notebook where I’m comfortable with wacky design risks lol.</span></p><p><strong>Notebook:</strong><span> Hobonichi Cousin (LOL)</span></p><p>Oh yes you read that right — I went BACK TO THE COUSIN.</p><p>Didn’t I…</p><p>Just… say…</p><p>How much I hated using the Hobonichi Cousin in 2024?
