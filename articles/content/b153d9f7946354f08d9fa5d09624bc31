Alternatively, users can upload a government-issued photo ID if they are 13 or older.</p><p>Roblox says all personal information is “deleted immediately after processing.” However many users online say they are unwilling to conduct age verification over privacy concerns.</p><p>Peope who have verified their ages are only allowed to chat to a small group of other players around their own age. For example, those verified as under 9 can only chat with players up to the age of 13. Players deemed to be 16 can chat with players between 13 and 20.</p></div></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The company initially rolled out the AI-powered age
