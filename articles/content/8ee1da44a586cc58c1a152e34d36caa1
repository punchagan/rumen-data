I am here to figure it out. They say, </span><a href="https://www.emiscahrose.com/blog/the-creative-adult-is-the-child-who-survived" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a creative adult is a child who survived. </a><span> I wonder if an aware creative adult is in pursuit of feeding their inner child’s desire.</span></p><p>Childlike curiosity is essential for success. A child is always curious.</p><p>When my nephew was three, his Rs were not rolling the right way. So I gave him words that start with R to pronounce and as I said rat, roll, rabbit and rocket. He repeated each one after me. He stopped before ‘rocket,’ looked at me confused and asked, “What is a rocket?” And I sat there knocked by the feather that he does not know because he is a child. And he simply asked.</p><p><span>The word “curious” originates from the Latin </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cura&amp;oq=curious+etymology&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORiABDIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgGEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyBwgHEAAY7wUyBwgIEAAY7wXSAQgzMjEwajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;mstk=AUtExfAlF5nIzedGs-t0Zd-fM1t67OntBBQiWyOYZQ4y1vKxW-w685wP4GgmYHRu9U2nqgfS0Wy_ogZT9it6BpGFzGGfSQDDB4_QltDEVhLvVmXMl7nvK5NMin1qE6HN3l-cgJGS1tNgvAORHEV1xwKbM5l1GT0sk00TpyxdaAvwJqxn2qI&amp;csui=3&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikqImM_ImRAxXXZWwGHQNaEpoQgK4QegQIARAC" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">cura</a><span>, meaning “care”. It entered English through Old French and originally meant “careful” or “diligent” before its modern sense of “inquisitive” emerged in the 14th century. Thus, originally to be curious meant to be careful or to be with care for something.</span></p><p><span>Interestingly, t</span><a href="https://www.howardbasshead.com/what-is-an-artist/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">he word ‘artist’ originates in the Latin “artista”, which describes a craftsman or someone skilled in the arts. This, in turn, was derived from “ars” or “artis”, translating to ‘art’.</a></p><p><span>Curious and artists both whisper the same thing at their roots—</span><em>care</em><span>. To be curious is to care enough to look closer. To be an artist is to care enough to do something skillfully. Maybe they’re not separate qualities at all, but two expressions of the same attentiveness.</span></p><p>And as I postulate this, I realise curiosity keeps both the child and artist alive.</p><p>I was a wide eyed bright child, always acing the task at hand. Competitive. Lauded for being competitive. Performing for approval. Winning competitions. But when I was by myself I loved playing make believe games. I loved reading fiction. I danced. I sang. Nobody told me to journal. It came to me. I wrote endlessly of the fictional world in my head. In my daydreams, I was my main character. Things revolved around me.</p><p>I was 12 years old when someone read my journal without me knowing. I walked into the classroom and my girlfriends at the time stood there reading my journal. I stood there aghast, mad and ashamed that someone knew of the secret world I made up for myself. It was years before I started journaling again. My words started wearing shame around them. But I never stopped reading. I read and I learnt until a new day when I couldn’t not write anymore. I found the strength in my words back.</p><p>As I grew up, choices started seeming overwhelming. I was a smart kid (like they say) then why could I not commit myself to a career choice. Little did I know then, you’re not supposed to. You’re supposed to try. And I tried.</p><p>I did the hard things because I felt good things lie at the other end of hard things. I went to law school. I went to grad school. I had the privilege to be conveniently making these choices. But all this while words called out to me, they tugged at my chest to announce that I belonged to them. All I wanted to be all along was an expresser of feelings. I feel deeply. I always did.</p><p>I wanted to express myself and equip others to express themselves. I wanted to write my words and I wanted to recite them. I wanted to incite feelings that I was feeling in others. I wanted to be seen. I wanted to be accepted. I wanted people to feel seen. I wanted people to feel accepted. And so I wrote. And it took me years before I realised words are where I feel at home.</p><p>JK Rowling wrote, “Words are our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it.” I live by that. Words are capable of big things. They have moved nations. Created new ones. Created new worlds. Words said by someone set new laws in motion. Words created slavery. And it was words that abolished it.</p><p>Words carry me. The only thing that will ever make me feel seen, accepted was sharing my words and so I set out to do this. Write. Share. Learn. Repeat.</p><p>I am working on the ‘repeating’ bit right now. I write for the sake of writing but sharing is a big part of it. Having felt seen in other’s works, I want my work to provide people with the same solace. A haven for being seen. A haven for motivation.</p><p>I recently moved from Singapore to Mumbai and shifted worlds from a consulting corporate worker to an aspiring artist. To become a Hindustani poet performer, to be precise. I have been on this journey for three months now, I find myself bewildered by what remains to be the parameters of calling oneself an artist.</p><p>For inspiration I look at historically successful artists. Not because they were successful, not because their work transcended generations but because I am intrigued with how they let their creativity flood their reality. It feels like their minds, their hands, their words, brush strokes, were willed by something greater than them to unveil what their brain was perceiving and bringing about.</p><p>Historical creators have created movements, moved by something that kept pressing upon the noggin in their head despite everything around them. Frida Kahlo painted while bedridden. Van Gogh was aware enough to admit himself at a psychiatric facility and yet painted like painting could save him. I’m certain it did until it couldn’t. His paintings are saving many today.</p><p>I have read books that have changed me. Books set in civilisations that we know of from history lessons but also told from the perspective of the people that lived at the time. Truly educating us about the evolution of pain, bravery and resilience that human beings have gone through.</p><p>Art is endless because art means skill. Because the evolution of skill is endless. Then what makes an artist? Someone who challenges the frontiers of the existing skill? What segregates an artist for the ages from one whose work will be short lived? Effort. Consistency. Curiosity. Frontiers.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg" width="736" height="899" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:899,&quot;width&quot;:736,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:85522,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://namrata28.substack.com/i/180470428?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8Ga!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40c05953-3cbb-4845-9a2f-cd7da8e68d96_736x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>by Alexis Carreiro on Pinterest</figcaption></figure></div><p>I am here trying to find my frontiers and in that, educating myself with what exists within the frontiers. It’s endless. It’s intimidatingly endless. I make it a goal everyday to do work that I enjoy, that I learn from and that brings me a little bit closer to finding my frontier. It is laborious work. It is delusional work. It is reaching your hand out in the dark, hoping you’ll find something wonderful because so far with every step you took you found something delightful.  It is believing that a creative idea exists in some corner of your brain, waiting to be extracted, unwound and rearranged to make sense of something you haven’t understood yet.</p><p> I wonder if it will ever be. If my purpose will ever be realised. But the thing with life is,  to make choices that bring you closer to the kind of person you want to be. And I want to be a free person. I want to freely express, help others express themselves and come back home to more curiosity, more care and more creative restlessness.</p><p>Six months back, my week was forty hours of nine to five, waiting for the weekend to feel better about myself. I was doing important work but it was not the least bit important to me. Today, I wake up with an empty slate. My day starts with words, I journal. Followed by more words, I write. I am building my writing muscle. Right now it’s 10.30 am on Monday morning and I am writing this. By afternoon, I’m editing the performance set for my debut show in February 2026—a deadline that both terrifies and anchors me. And I will end the day reading things that inspire me to write.</p><p>Right now, I’m a 28-year-old who walked away from a consulting career, now in Mumbai, learning to live with less certainty and more curiosity.  In pursuit of understanding creativity and art, trying to build skill that is learnt and remembered, trying to create the illusion of familiarity with every part of the frontier as I discover it. I have decided I want to be a performing artist who writes feelings and recites what a rattled heart wants to hear in order to be comforted. </p><p>I am an artist because I care.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>
