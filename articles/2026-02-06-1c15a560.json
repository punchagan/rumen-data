  "description": "I realized recently that rather than using “the right tool for the job” I’ve been using the tool at the job and that’s mostly determined the programming languages I know. So over the last couple months I’ve put a lot of time into experimenting with languages I don’t get to use at work. My goal hasn’t been proficiency; I’m more interested in forming an opinion on what each language is good for.",
